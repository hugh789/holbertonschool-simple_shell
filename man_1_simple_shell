NAME
            hsh - A simple shell program
SYNOPSIS
            hsh

DESCRIPTION
            .hsh 
            is a custom UNIX command line interpreter, built entirely with C language that provides a command-line interface. It executes commands read from the standard input. Memory management and ‘end of file’ conditions have been handled. 

OPTIONS
            None.

FEATURES
            Interactive Shell: hsh operates in an interactive mode, prompting the user for commands with a $ symbol.
            
            Command Execution: Users can enter commands and arguments, separated by spaces. hsh parses the input and attempts to execute the command.

            Built-in Commands: hsh currently supports two built-in commands:    
            env: Prints the environment variables.
            exit: Exits the shell program.

            Command Path Handling: hsh searches for executable commands in the PATH environment variable. 
            If a command is not found in the PATH, it displays an error message.

            Error Handling: hsh provides basic error handling for situations like commands not found, allocation failures, and forking errors.

EXAMPLES
            List environment variables:
            $ env
            HOME=/home/user
            PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
            ...
            Exit the shell:
            $ exit
            
            Execute a program located in the PATH:
            $ ls
            ... (output of the ls command)
            
            Attempt to execute a program not found in the PATH:
            $ not_found_command
            ./hsh: 1: not_found_command: not found
